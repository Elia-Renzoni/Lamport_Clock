# Lamport Clock
The Lamport clock is a logical clock created by Lamport Leslie in 1978 that allows to order events in communication between nodes. Being a logical clock overcomes the problems of physical clocks, these are due to the fact that physical clocks are unpersistent compared to the concept of randomness, mind logical clocks no. <br>

Lamport Clock is made of an interger held locally by the nodes in the system. When an event occurred the node must increment of a value the logical clock. By event we mean  messages sent or received and the execution of some code in the node. <br>
